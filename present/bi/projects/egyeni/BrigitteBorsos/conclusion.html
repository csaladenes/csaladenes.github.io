		<center>      The emerging evidence available to us is suggesting that there may be some significant risks posed by social media use to young peopleâ€™s mental health and emotional wellbeing. However, research is thus far limited and due to social media being a relatively new introduction to the lives of young people, far more long-term research will be necessary before we are able to fully understand its effects. We would like to see academic institutions, independent researchers and social media companies fund and undertake much more research into the subject, especially in developing countries like Romania, where mental health problems are usually frowned upon and dismissed by the general population.</center>
