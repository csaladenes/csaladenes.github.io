Social network penetration worldwide is ever-increasing. Social networking is one of the most popular online activities with high user engagement rates and expanding mobile possibilities.
Due to a constant presence in the lives of their users, social networks have a decidedly strong social impact. The blurring between offline and virtual life as well as the concept of digital identity and online social interactions are some of the aspects that have emerged in recent discussions.</p>
<p>Some people may be starting to come to grips with the fact that social media isn’t so great for mental health. Others may think that getting on it will give them a boost—but especially depending on how you spend your time on it, you may well feel worse after using. Plenty of studies have found correlations between higher social media use and poorer mental health, including depression, anxiety, feelings of loneliness and isolation, lower self-esteem, and even suicidality.</p>
<p>These visualizations are meant to show the increase in social media usage during the past years and also why and how we use it; while focusing on its negative effects and highlighting the impact they had on our well-being.</p>
